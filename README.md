# Welcome to MacDjango

This Django application has been built to try and dsiplay the different types of projects we can build with django, I have kept each subject within its own app, if you where to build a project base don one subject it may make sense to use multiple apps to break out the content/logic. 


## The Projects

 - MacChat
 - MacBlog
 https://neutronx.github.io/django-markdownx/example/
 - MacBookings
 - MacForum
 - MAcSocial
